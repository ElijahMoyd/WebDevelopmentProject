    <p style="font-family: sans-serif"> Raster Image: This was created in Adobe Photoshop 2018. I used an image with me and my mother which I edit to only have me in picture so I can put myself in another image which consists of Marvel characters. To make sure I fit myself in that image, I had to temper with the size and adjest the lighting so it would look like I fit in the image I put myself in as if im part of the picture with the characters.  </p>

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Vector Self Portrait: This was created in Adobe Illustrator 2018. I edited the same image of me and mother to make it seem like the photo was taken in a time where photos were black and white to make people think that this photo was old. </p>

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Gif Animation: I created this in Adobe Photoshop 2018. I used an image which had a man proposing to a woman. I created a text bubble and by each frame, I had words that said "She said no." for comedic purposes. </p>

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Audio Project: I created this in an multi-track audio editor and recorder called Audacity. The audio project I created tells a story of two criminals surrounded by the police. Little do they know that the criminals have on more trick of getting out.  </p>
