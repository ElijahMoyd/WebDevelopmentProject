    <p style="font-family: sans-serif"> Raster Image: This was created in Adobe Illustrator 2019. I used an image with me and my mother which I edit to only have me in picture so I can put myself in another image which consists of Marvel characters. To make sure I fit myself in that image, I had to temper with the size and adjest the lighting so it would look like I fit in the image I put myself in as if im part of the picture with the characters. I choose this image because it contributes to one of my interests which is comics. I only combined the images of me and the page of a comic book which had the superheroes. The most challenging part is me figuring out how I could blend in and look like I was with the heroes. I solve this by using the adjustments and editing both images so it has the same colors and saturation. I also create an outline of the image to myself so it looks like I was in a comic.

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Vector Self Portrait: This was created in Adobe Illustrator 2018. I edited the same image of me and mother to make it seem like the photo was taken in a time where photos were black and white to make people think that this photo was old.  The inspiration for this work comes from the ideology of family. The grayness of the picture represents time as if the picture took place in early times. The challenging part of making this was choosing the right image trace. I solve it by experimenting every single option and testing out what I could do. </p>

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Gif Animation: The idea of this GIF came from observing and looking through pictures to see if I could come up with anything humorous. I used the shape object to form a speech bubble to team like he talking or thinking of it. The hardest part of this assignment was saving the file as a psd since I wanted to make sure all the layers were there and it won’t look cramped up. Thankfully, it came up as I thought I would. </p>

            <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Audio Project: I created this in an multi-track audio editor and recorder called Audacity. This story for this piece is about two criminal surrounded by the police but had one more trick in their sleeve. I haven’t used effects or anything that will alter the sounds. The most challenging part of this project was thinking about the story. I’ve solved it by experimenting sounds and think about how it fits together.  </p>
